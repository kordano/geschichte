[[:chapter {:tag "synching" :title "Synching protocol of replikativ"}]]

"This chapter describes the synching protocol of replikativ. The synching protocol is the stateful network layer which ensures that updates (commits) to repositories propagate quickly and without conflicts. It is out of necessity eventual consistent, but tries to keep the diverging time frames as small as possible. "


[[:section {:tag "full-message-protocol" :title "Full Message Protocol"}]]

"The messaging protocol benefits from the *CRDT* nature of the metadata and has as little state as possible. Propagation can fail at any point and the network is still in a (locally) consistent state, so clients can keep writing without any synchronization. There is no server/client distinction except for the fact that some peers cannot accept connections (e.g. web-clients, clients behind a NAT). Each operation is acknowledged. As you can see in the following test, fetching actual transaction values happens based on need, only the metadata changes are pushed. User authentication as well as a trust mechanism between servers is not yet implemented, but will limit the propagation of values in the network at some point. For privacy encryption of transactional data is planned. Metadata here contains little private information and can be obfuscated."

"This is a demonstration of the low-level message API of the protocol. This API is subject to change and not supposed to be used by applications directly. For sake of simplicity we have replaced ids and values with small integers here as they are sufficient for the actual synching procedure."
